This is a Godot Implementation of my PhoenixFireFightLibrary

https://github.com/JakeTrans/PhoenixFireFightLibrary

This is a working implementation of the Library and as present is a basic one on one fight we a wall as cover to show what can be done

This is fully built in C# rather than GDScript simply as my own comfort.  

If you run into any error or if you see any improvements/suggestions please feel feel to raise a Issue or a Pull Request if you've done the work
